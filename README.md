# Performance Comparison of Clustering Techniques

## Introduction
This project conducts a comparative study of several clustering methods by applying distinct data preprocessing strategies. The aim is to assess the effectiveness of each clustering technique using a variety of evaluation metrics and identify the best-performing combination.

## Dataset Details
- **Dataset**: Iris Flower Dataset  
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)  
- **Summary**: This dataset includes 150 observations across three Iris species (*Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*), with four measured attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Data Preprocessing Methods
1. **Z-Score Standardization**: Normalizes features to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.
2. **Min-Max Scaling**: Rescales values to fall within the interval [0, 1].
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces data to two principal components for enhanced interpretability and visualization.

## Clustering Methods Explored
1. **K-Means Algorithm**
2. **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)**
3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **Silhouette Coefficient**: Assesses how closely related an object is to its own cluster versus others.
2. **Davies-Bouldin Score**: Gauges cluster compactness and separation.
3. **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**: Evaluates clustering outcomes relative to ground truth labels (when available).

## Results Visualization
Below is a graph comparing Silhouette Scores obtained using various algorithms and preprocessing techniques:

## Summary & Findings
The results, based on Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and ARI, highlight the best-performing clustering and preprocessing combinations. This study illustrates how data transformation affects clustering outcomes and outlines the pros and cons of each method examined.
